# Metal_Training-CNN
Training a Convolutional Neural Network to recognize metals surface defects using Keras (TensorFlow backend) with [colab.](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1sAI-tyUE9kzdbFtJKEoqaaEpU4ZjsT7x?usp=sharing)

## Database
[NEU Surface Defect Database](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kaustubhdikshit/neu-surface-defect-database)

Six kinds of typical surface defects of the hot-rolled steel strip are collected, i.e., rolled-in scale (RS), patches (Pa), crazing (Cr), pitted surface (PS), inclusion (In) and scratches (Sc). The database includes 1,800 grayscale images: 300(split into 240 images for training and 60 images for testing.) samples each of six different kinds of typical surface defects.
